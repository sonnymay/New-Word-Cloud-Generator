# New-Word-Cloud-Generator

This is a simple Python script that generates word clouds based on input text using the `wordcloud` library. It creates visually appealing representations of word frequencies, where the size of each word is proportional to its frequency in the input text.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine. Additionally, you need to install the `wordcloud` library. You can install it using pip:

```shell
pip install wordcloud
```

### Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the script file (`word_cloud_generator.py`) directly.

2. Open the script file in your Python IDE or text editor.

3. Customize the input text by modifying the `text` variable in the script.

4. Run the script.

```shell
python word_cloud_generator.py
```

5. The generated word cloud will be displayed as an image.

## Example

Here's an example usage of the word cloud generator:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from wordcloud import WordCloud

def generate_word_cloud(text):
    wordcloud = WordCloud(width=800, height=400, background_color='white').generate(text)

    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
    plt.imshow(wordcloud, interpolation='bilinear')
    plt.axis('off')
    plt.show()

# Example usage
text = "Hello world, hello python, hello word cloud!"
generate_word_cloud(text)
```

## Customization

You can customize the appearance of the word cloud by modifying the parameters of the `WordCloud` class in the `generate_word_cloud` function. For example, you can adjust the width, height, background color, font, or colormap.

Feel free to experiment and adapt the code to suit your specific requirements!
